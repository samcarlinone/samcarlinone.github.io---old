<h2 id="Postmortem"><a href="#Postmortem" class="headerlink" title="Postmortem"></a>Postmortem</h2><p>There are three comments on this game, only one wasn’t posted by me and I think it is a good summary of the gameplay</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… I can say it’s solid. 3/5 from me, but… It’s LACKS a creator’s touch. I don’t see much originality in here. It’s not very exciting to play it. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I definitely agree. However my goal for this project wasn’t really to make an amazing game, actually I was simply trying to make <em>a</em> game.</p>
<p>Most of my projects up to this point were never finished. Largely due to the fact I still hadn’t figured out how to easily split a JS project into multiple files. As such, most of the projects I worked on would reach somewhere between 1-2K lines of code before they got too cumbersome to work with. This project still somewhat suffered from this issue, but I took a lot more time to plan out the structure ahead of time. And it worked.</p>
<p>Still there were some good points. The various buttons in-game would flash to indicate they were actually buttons, a piece of UI work I was very proud of at the time. The whole game stayed with the pixelated theme. And I think the colors mode was actually unique, and somewhat fun.</p>
<p>As much as anything else this project reminds me how much I have learned since I made it.</p>
