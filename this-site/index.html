        <h2 id="Postmortem"><a href="#Postmortem" class="headerlink" title="Postmortem"></a>Postmortem</h2><p>This site took way longer to make than it should have. Why? Because I spent way to long fiddling around with trying to get a blog running with Ghost in Docker. Then I found Hexo and everything was better.</p>
<p>At least for me, Hexo is perfect. It takes a series of Markdown files, some templates, and some styling and spits out a plain HTML, JS, CSS site. Which I can then put on any static host, ready for anyone to view. No need to worry about dynamic hosting, or waiting for the server to spin up every time someone wants to see it. The only downside is manually having to push the updated site code when I make a new post (although this could be as simple as a git commit + push).</p>
<p>In terms of styling I actually did it all myself. The only external stylesheet I used was normalize.css. In the past it would have been harder to get a site that worked in major browsers and mobile without using a library. Now, flexbox makes it really easy to make a responsive design that adapts gracefully to most modern devices. This site also doesn’t have to work in IE which makes cuts out one of the main reasons to use bloated styling libraries.</p>
<p>For the animated background I am just using a bit of JS I hacked together. It basically creates a 2D string array, which is mapped into a series of spans inside a div. I could increase performance by only updating divs that change, but since it only updates once a second anyway performance isn’t as much of a concern. And I actually measure execution speed anyway, which allows me to stop running the animation on very old computers and mobile devices.</p>
<p>In terms of scale this project is pretty small, but I think a focused design and well defined set of goals have helped this project really come together. I can’t wait to add the next project.</p>
